                    <p>
                        Let me tell you about myself –
                        I'm a software developer who loves to learn and try new things.
                        I'm from Yemen and belong to a small family. I'm really good at computer
                        programming using languages like Python, Java, and Go. And guess what?
                        I'm actively expanding my abilities by diving into JavaScript, web development tools, and more.</p>
    
                    <p>I know a bit about fancy stuff like machine learning and data science,
                        It's like using math to teach computers to be smart.
                        I enjoy playing around with numbers and patterns to make samrt apps.</p>
    
                    <p>My journey led me to spend four productive years as a researcher at a university. My focus was on the
                        integration of medical fields with computer technologies, bridging the gap between
                        science and innovation. Additionally,
                        teaching is a passion of mine – I find joy in imparting knowledge and aiding others in
                        their learning and growth journeys.</p>

            <div class="hobbies">
                
                <div class="hobbies-txt" id="hobbies-txt">
                    <p>Outside of all the tech stuff, I'm into reading books and drawing fun pictures from my imagination.
                        And when I'm not busy with that, I like playing football with my friends or having adventures in
                        video games.</p>
    
                    <p>I really like classical music – it's like classy music from a long time ago.
                        It makes me feel happy and calm. And you know what else?
                        Additionally, I have a rather unique hobby – playing with data. Yes,
                        I enjoy converting raw data into structured formats, gleaning valuable insights,
                        and making informed decisions, all with the assistance of data analysis tools.
                    </p>
